# Kanoon AI Front-End Engineer Coding Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Kanoon AI Front-End Engineer Coding Challenge! This challenge is designed to assess your skills in React, Material-UI (MUI), and your ability to integrate with a backend API. You'll be building a simplified version of a legal document management system.


## Backend Integration

We've provided a simple Node.js backend API for you to integrate with. The API endpoints are as follows:

- GET /api/documents: Fetch all documents
- GET /api/documents/:id: Fetch a specific document
- POST /api/documents: Create a new document
- GET /api/documents/search?q=:query: Search for documents

You'll need to implement the API calls in your React application using a library like Axios or fetch.

## Bonus Points (We recommend you do at least 1-2 of these!)

- Add a simple animation or transition effect when navigating between views.
- Implement unit tests for your React components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Add a dark mode toggle using MUI's theming capabilities.
- Implement document categorization and filtering based on document types.
- Login/logout functionality that preserves log in state across different components.


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
4. The backend server can be started using `npm run server` or `yarn server`.
